                              <p dir=false data-test-bidi>Most musicians would love to have a moment that defined their
                                career. A moment when they find something that sets them apart and pushes them forward
                                into unknown territory. If, as an artist, you’re lucky enough to have that moment, we -
                                as the listening public - can only hope somebody was there to press record. If that
                                moment exists in a song, we want to hear every bit of it. But what about what came
                                before. And after.<br /><br />This season on “The Jump”, acclaimed singer / songwriter
                                Shirley Manson (Garbage) sits down with seven of the most influential musicians of the
                                last two decades (Neko Case, Esperanza Spalding, Big Boi, Dave 1, Courtney love, Karen O
                                and Perfume Genius) to discuss the song that represents their artistic moment of truth
                                and the impact that song had on both their careers, and their lives.</p>

                              <p dir=false data-test-bidi>Most musicians would love to have a moment that defined their
                                career. A moment when they find something that sets them apart and pushes them forward
                                into unknown territory. If, as an artist, you’re lucky enough to have that moment, we -
                                as the listening public - can only hope somebody was there to press record. If that
                                moment exists in a song, we want to hear every bit of it. But what about what came
                                before. And after.<br /><br />This season on “The Jump”, acclaimed singer / songwriter
                                Shirley Manson (Garbage) sits down with seven of the most influential musicians of the
                                last two decades (Neko Case, Esperanza Spalding, Big Boi, Dave 1, Courtney love, Karen O
                                and Perfume Genius) to discuss the song that represents their artistic moment of truth
                                and the impact that song had on both their careers, and their lives.</p>

                            <p dir=false data-test-bidi>Found the jump because I&#39;m a hrishikesh hirway fan and read
                              that he&#39;s executive producing. I&#39;m not a songwriter but I can so relate to the
                              idea of having that moment when you send your work into the world and it changes your life
                              and you didn&#39;t realize it. I have ADHD so &lt;3 that the episodes are short so far.

Listen as they tell the fascinating stories of their songs’ creation in never-before-heard detail, and further peel back the curtain on this magical process.  \n \nSongland's podcast debuted with the release of four introductory episodes, one with each of the three producers on the show, Ryan Tedder (Beyoncé, Adele, Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney, U2);  Ester Dean (Nicki Minaj, Katy Perry); and Shane McAnally (40 #1 Country Hits), and also one featuring Dave Stewart, co-creator and executive producer of Songland, who also happens to have a string of number one hits of his own as a songwriter, including of course his many hits with Eurythmics, but also with No Doubt and many others since.  These four are some of the top songwriters in the business, and they tell us about how they got there, and walk us through a song of their own as well: Dave Stewart talks about writing and recording ‘Sweet Dreams’ with Annie Lennox in their practice space above a framing factory in less than an hour; Ryan Tedder about finishing the track for Beyoncé’s ‘XO’ on an airplane, and coming up with the final hook on a jog through an Australian park; Ester Dean describes getting a middle-of-the-night phone call from Nicki Minaj to work on ‘Superbass,’ and Shane McAnally talks about writing from a very personal story for Kacey Musgraves’ ‘Mama’s Broken Heart’, which went on to become a #1 hit for Miranda Lambert. \n \nSubsequent episodes feature will.i.am telling how the Black Eyed Peas “Where’s the Love” got a last-minute addition from Justin Timberlake; John Legend and winning writer Tebby Burrows going deep into Tebby’s winning song “We Need Love”; Kelsea Ballerini and Darius Coleman taking us through the evolution of her new hit “Better Luck Next Time”; the Jonas Brothers and Able Heart on “Greenlight”; Meghan Trainor on “All About That Bass”; Aloe Blacc on “The Man”, and much more..   \n \nJoin us for NBC’s Songland Podcast, a production of the iHeart Radio Podcast Network.  You will never hear your favorite songs the same way again."},"feedUrl":"https://feeds.megaphone.fm/HSW7280106802","kind":"serial","name":"NBC's Songland Podcast","releaseDateTime":"2019-07-03T03:00:00.000Z","subscriptionUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/DZR.woa/wa/subscribePodcast?cc=us\u0026id=1463444145","trackCount":10,"url":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/nbcs-songland-podcast/id1463444145"},"relationships":{"artwork":{"data":{"type":"image","id":"ember39899294"}},"episodes":{"data":[{"id":"1000443493387","type":"media/podcast-episode"},{"id":"1000442780578","type":"media/podcast-episode"},{"id":"1000441993045","type":"media/podcast-episode"},{"id":"1000441227841","type":"media/podcast-episode"},{"id":"1000440638184","type":"media/podcast-episode"},{"id":"1000440006540","type":"media/podcast-episode"}],"meta":{"next":"/v1/catalog/us/podcasts/1463444145/episodes?offset=6"}}}},{"id":"1453114629","type":"media/podcast","attributes":{"genreNames":["Comedy","Podcasts"],"contentRating":"explicit","userRating":{"value":4.5,"ratingCount":583,"ratingCountList":[29,32,25,37,460],"ariaLabelForRatings":"4.5 stars"},"artistName":"Team Coco \u0026 Earwolf","copyright":"© Earwolf Media, LLC","description":{"standard":"Conan writers Mike Sweeney and Jessie Gaskell, take you behind the pompadour with exclusive and extended versions of their favorite interviews and stand-up from the week in late night, as well as the stories behind them. \nDiscover the origins of characters like Crooner Ghost Artie Kendall, and meet people-who-should-be-characters like Jordan Schlansky.

That space is, of course, “New Jersey,” and it’s fitting because it was from here (this very house, in fact) in 1987, that I wrote a letter to our guest, Ian MacKaye.  Ian’s new band, Fugazi, was asking people to rethink their relationships to each other in the space of “the pit” and consider not slam dancing/moshing.  This was a radical proposition back then, but I understood it, and I respected it.  I think coming from a break dancing background made the idea of a more inclusive dancing aspect to punk shows appealing to me.  What I didn’t respect, and what prompted me to write the letter, was seeing a bunch of people who had traveled with the band up from DC to The Anthrax in Norwalk, Ct., physically grabbing people and stopping them from slamming/moshing.  It seemed like just another form of policing and fascism to me.  It was an angry letter.\n Ian wrote me back - he agreed with me and assured me that the people doing this were not under instructions from the band and he didn’t agree with the physical policing of the space either, and that was that.\n We reconnected in person when I moved to DC about five years later, and Ian remembered the exchange.  He SAYS he kept the letter, and I live under a standing threat that it will be produced for all to read if our arguments ever get TOO argumentative.  And as I sit here thinking about this now, I realize it’s one of many things I’d like to revisit with him, because I wonder how our stances on that issue may have evolved.  I’ve certainly spent a lot of time on the edges of pits since then, attempting to take the blows so people less willing (or able) to can just watch the bands.  I’ve jumped off my own stages to stop fights.  Would I do it to stop unruly pit action these days?  At MY shows these days, it pretty much never happens, but I might.  You take a responsibility for the space when you take the stage - it’s a responsibility that Ian MacKaye still takes seriously, and his is an example that I’m glad I’ve had in my life.\n Other things we discuss that I’d like to expand on and encourage our listeners to think more about are:\n 1. Characters and masks - I keep thinking about this idea of what’s “real” and what’s not, and I’m thinking more about who gets to define that and what it means to different cultures.  Yes, as we discuss in the interview, one can see how a certain type of person uses masks and characters to AVOID responsibility, but what about the idea of being able to self-create one’s identity?  What about drag and camp?  Glam and goth?  What about when society tells you you’re NOT “real” what then?\n 2. Well… maybe just the one thing is good for now - I’ve already gone on too long.  Feel free to tweet at us if anything else strikes you!\n Also, I realize that I said Dischord started in the 70s - I was thinking the Teen Idles 7” came out in 78/79, but it was, of course, 1980.\n  \n SPONSOR!\n Our sponsor for this episode is MYRO - natural, plant-based deodorant subscription with a reusable capsule dispenser!

It was when we started to discuss the amazing \"PEN15\" (on Hulu); but I wound up dropping us back in (after the second break) to the middle of that section because I felt like to lose it entirely would also have been to lose where the conversation went from there, re. women and storytelling in the industry, and I didn't want to lose that.\n It's not hard to follow, but if a stray reference to PEN15 throws you off for a second, that's why.\n Our sponsors for this episode are:\n Casper Mattress - go to casper.com/art and enter \"art\" at checkout for $50 off select mattresses!\n Storyworth - visit storyworth.com/art for $20 off your subscription!\n Order Emily Nussbaum's \"I Like to Watch: Arguing my Way Through the TV Revolution\" at emilynussbaum.com\n Find us all at:\n @tedleo\n @aimeemann\n @artofprocesspod\n @emilynussbaum\n @MaxFunHQ","short":"WE'RE BACK.

We have not actually been away for longer than our usual bi-weekly hiatus, but it feels like we have.  IN THIS EPISODE we sit down in her home city of Chicago with artist and graphic novelist Emil Ferris.  Emil's book \"My Favorite Thing is Monsters\" affected both Aimee and me deeply; SO deeply that, at our mutual friend, designer Gail Marowitz's suggestion, I was lucky enough to be able to enlist Emil into doing the art for my own last album, The Hanged Man (which was also, by the way, under Gail's brilliant design supervision). \n Our conversation ranges from subtle energy and a race of benevolent vampires, to how blockages and limitations in one area of life can lead to deeper understanding and greater heights in others.\n As mentioned, there is a self-imposed content warning on this one because we do delve a little bit into childhood trauma, specifically, sexual abuse.  In accordance with MY experience and ever-changing perspective and standards CURRENTLY, it's not that heavy, but I realize that we're all wherever we are with this sort of thing, and I want to give you, the listener, the opportunity to opt out of approximately minutes 36:30 to 40:00.  This is audibly mentioned in the episode as well.\n There's also some light goofing about cigarette smoking and alcohol intake, a little earlier on, so I want to put up a flag about that for you as well.\n I also want to link you to some resources, should you need them, and will do so below; both to RAINN, and an organization specifically geared toward helping men through this, called 1in6.\n Trust me, though - there is more light and joy in this episode than what I'm describing may make it sound like here, and we hope you'll come out of it a member of the Starfish Army, under Commandante Aimee Mann, and, I guess… Subcommandante… me, with… Special Advisor Emil Ferris?  I don't know. I think you get to choose your own rank.  We have to figure that part out.\n Volume TWO of \"My Favorite Thing is Monsters\" is due out soon, so please keep eyes peeled for that, and enjoy the show!\n  \n LINKS:\n Emil Ferris online\n \"My Favorite Thing is Monsters\" \n \"The Hanged Man\" (at Gail Marowitz's design site!) \n \"Sunrise,\" the silent film we talk about on Youtube\n  RAINN \n 1in6 \n  \n Find Us:\n @Emilferrisdraws\n @AimeeMann \n @TedLeo \n @artofprocesspod \n @MaxFunHQ \n  ","short":"Ep. 10 - EMIL FERRIS \"Benevolent Vampires and the Starfish Army\" CW: childhood sexual assault Welcome back!

He gives us some great insight into what makes for good and bad political speechwriting, and how it dovetails and differs with dramatic writing.\n The overarching theme of the episode is the \"constituency of one\" - who is your actual audience, who are you trying to please… Something we've all become a lot more familiar with in the political realm these past two years.\n A couple of other things that get mentioned that I just want to address really quickly:\n 1. My Medicare plan would not suck.\n 2. It's not that hard for ME to see Aimee converting to Catholicism.\n 3. It's true - Air Force 2 IS, in fact, a tiny fraction of the size of Air Force 1, AND, apparently, there's no booze served on it!\n I also really wanted to include some examples of the speeches Eli's worked on, but it's frustratingly hard to find anything by former Mayor of New York City, David Dinkins, NYC's first and only black mayor, from his time in office (the time of Eli's tenure as speechwriter), but I did find a video of election night coverage, that adds a lot of context and includes his concession speech, which you can find at around the 24:00 minute mark.  Incidentally, this is the night that he lost to a man I cannot say enough bad things about, current cable news ghoul, Rudy Giuliani.  I'd forgotten how contentious this loss was, and it's interesting to watch this speech, given what Eli mentions about being gracious to the point of making oneself nauseous, aaaand unfortunately, it gets cut short in the video.
